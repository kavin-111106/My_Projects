MODERN CALCULTOR

This is my first web development project , so i just used html, css, and javascript.

In the .html file, I have added basic calculator operations like addition , division etc... with clear display.

In the .js file, i have created functions to appendValue, calculate, clearDisplay() and catch if an error is thrown.

In the css file, i have used grid display model as it is a calculator.
